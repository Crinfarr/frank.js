        Although it will work with most settings, I would recommend using 8K textures and putting the storybox on the top bar.<br/><br/>
        This engine is also open source on <a href='http://github.com/Crinfarr/Frank.js'>My git,</a> and runs uncompiled on web.<p>\n\n\n
        Play around with the settings all you want, I have never removed one so all my experiments are here.<p>\n\n\n</p>
        p.s. arrow keys left and right are also supported for navigating the story.<p>\n</p>
        p.p.s at least try it, I spent like 20 minutes making it work right.<p>\n</p>
        p.p.p.s all images taken from the first page of google search results because I am lazy.`
